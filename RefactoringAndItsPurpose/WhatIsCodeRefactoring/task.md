# Task 1/4: What is code refactoring

**_Refactoring_** is a process of modifying source code without changing its behavior. For example, renaming a method or
extracting a _magic constant_ into a separate variable. It improves code readability but doesn’t change what code does.

The purpose of refactoring is to **improve code readability and simplify its maintenance**. Usually, software developers
work in teams on code bases and spend considerable time reading each other’s code, so it is important to make your code
clear and clean.
